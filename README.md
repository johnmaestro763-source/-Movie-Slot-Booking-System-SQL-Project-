# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Booking SQL Project

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  
This SQL project is designed to analyze a **Movie Booking System** dataset using core and intermediate SQL concepts. It demonstrates how SQL can be used for **data extraction, transformation, and analysis** to generate insights about movies, bookings, customers, and payments.  

The project focuses on **real-world use cases** such as tracking customer activity, identifying revenue trends, and managing show details using SQL queries.
